"Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I'm possible!"
"The bad news is time flies. The good news is you're the pilot."
"You don't always need a plan. Sometimes you just need to breathe, trust, let go and see what happens."
"You can be everything. You can be the infinite amount of things that people are."
"I'm not going to continue knocking that old door that doesn't open for me. I'm going to create my own door and walk through that."
"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light."
"All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination."
"Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud."
"Wake up determined, go to bed satisfied."
"Don't try to lessen yourself for the world; let the world catch up to you."
"You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream."
"Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope."
"You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible."
